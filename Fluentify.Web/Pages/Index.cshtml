    <p>
        Dear students, when working on projects in a solution, it's important to make sure that all project names and namespaces are properly renamed to reflect the content of your work.
        Please ensure that there are no example project names left in your solution.
        To simplify this process, I recommend using the "rename solution" and global search features available in Visual Studio.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to ensure that your solution is properly named and organized. I wish you all the best with your coding endeavors, and happy coding!
    </p>
