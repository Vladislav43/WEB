The ILTO project was developed using the following technologies:

 -  .NET - free, open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern apps and powerful cloud services.
 -  Azure - cloud computing platform and a set of services provided by Microsoft for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.
 -  Entity Framework - object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET developers that enables them to work with databases using .NET objects, simplifying the process of data access and manipulation.
 -  SQL Server - relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data, including storing, querying, and retrieving data.
 -  App Service - set of cloud-based services provided by Microsoft that enable developers and businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications and services in the cloud, including computing, storage, networking, databases, analytics, and more.
 -  MSTest - unit testing framework for .NET developers that allows them to write and execute automated tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of their code.
 -  NuGet packages - type of software package used in the Microsoft .NET ecosystem, containing compiled code and other resources, and are used by developers to easily add functionality to their projects and share code between teams.

### How to run a project on localhost 
Instructions for compiling the project locally from GitHub:

 -  Clone the repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/Vladislav43/WEB.git`
 -  Navigate to the cloned project folder using the command: `cd WEB`
 -  Make sure you have the .NET runtime environment installed on your computer. If you don't have .NET on your computer, you can download it from the official Microsoft website: `https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download`
 -  Open the command prompt and enter the command: `dotnet build` This command will build the project and check if everything is set up correctly.
 -  If everything goes well, start the web server by executing the command: `dotnet run`
 -  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`. You should see the home page of the web application.
 -  To run the application on a local server, you need to install the dependency packages. To do this, navigate to the WEB project folder and execute the command: `npm install`.
 -  If you need to make changes to the project, execute the command: `git pull` to get the latest version from GitHub.
